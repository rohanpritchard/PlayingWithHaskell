## bracketsCheckMonad.hs
This was a super basic program that asks you to input a string, and checks whether the string has valid brackets. I made this to work on my skills with monads, and how to create instances of monads. It clearly would have been easy to implement with Maybes instead of my own 'Validity' datatype, but it was for practice.
